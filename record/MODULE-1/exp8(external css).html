    <h1>SELECTING CLASS</h1>
    <p class="xyz"> Your eyes pour the moonlight on my path as I turn my back to you. In the dead of the night, I walk with my family, away from my home, my street, my town, and what was till yesterday- my country.<br></p>
    <h2>SELECTING ID</h2>
    <p id="googleceo">My family moves in a huddle. Alone, amongst a sea of people. Clutching each other’s hands. As if we could be more lost than we already are. My father, mother, brothers, and sisters are watchful, looking back every now and then-half expecting the earth they are walking on to swallow them.<br></p>
    <h3>ATTRIBUTE</h3>
    <p class="abc">I have walked to the brink of what held us together. After this turn, you will not be able to see the speck that I have become now. The speck that has entered the vortex created by time.<br></p>
    <h4>CHILD SELECTOR</h4>
    <p>You didn’t look back. Till you reached the very edge of the drop from where you could never climb back. Not in near future.<br><a>I hoped you will stay safe. When you walked through the rubble and dodged the murderous mobs baying for blood. When you squeezed into the train.</a> Till you reached Amritsar.</p><br>
